# 🚀 Task-8: Deploy Strapi on AWS ECS Fargate using Terraform with Monitoring

## 📌 Objective

Deploy a Dockerized **Strapi CMS** application on **AWS ECS Fargate** using **Terraform Infrastructure as Code**, integrate **Amazon ECR** for container registry and enable **CloudWatch logging & monitoring**.

---

## 🧱 Architecture

Developer → Docker Build → Amazon ECR → Terraform → ECS Fargate → CloudWatch Logs → Live Strapi App

---

## 🔹 Services Used

* AWS ECS (Fargate)
* AWS ECR (Container Registry)
* AWS CloudWatch (Monitoring & Logs)
* AWS VPC & Security Groups
* Terraform (IaC)
* Docker (Containerization)

---

## ⚙️ Deployment Workflow

### Step 1 — Dockerize Application

* Created Dockerfile for Strapi app
* Built Docker image locally
* Tested container on port **1337**

### Step 2 — Push Image to Amazon ECR

* Created ECR repository
* Logged in using AWS CLI
* Tagged & pushed Docker image

### Step 3 — Infrastructure Provisioning (Terraform)

Terraform created:

* VPC & Subnets
* Security Groups
* ECS Cluster
* Task Definition
* Fargate Service
* CloudWatch Log Group

### Step 4 — Run Application

ECS service pulled image from ECR and started container automatically.
